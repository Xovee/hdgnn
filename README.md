# SI-HDGNN: Quantifying the Scientific Impact via Heterogeneous Dynamical Graph Neural Network

This repo provides a reference implementation of **SI-HDGNN** as described in the paper:

>  Quantifying the Scientific Impact via Heterogeneous Dynamical Graph Neural Network  
>  [Xovee Xu](https://xovee.cn), Fan Zhou, Ce Li, Goce Trajcevski, Ting Zhong, and Kunpeng Zhang 
>  Submitted for review  

## Requirements
The code was tested with `Python 3.7`, `tensorflow-gpu 2.0.1`, `torch 1.0.1` and `Cuda 10.0`. Install the dependencies via Anaconda: 

```shell
# create conda virtual environment
conda create --name hdgnn python=3.7 cudatoolkit=10.0 cudnn=7.6.5 pytorch=1.0.1 torchvision=0.2.2 -c pytorch

# activate environment
conda activate hdgnn

# install other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the codes

See [README](./codes/README.md) in `./codes/`.

## Todos

I plan to optimize the code in the near future, sorry for the inconvenience that recent codes are hard to read or lack of annotations.
